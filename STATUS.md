# Status — what's done, what's pending

Prohibitorum's roadmap, with v0.1 (this commit) as the rescope + decoupling
skeleton and v0.1.1 through v0.7+ ahead.

## v0.1 (current commit) — rescope + decoupling

The first commit on this branch (`3d79583`) lifted the identity-layer
code from its origin project and renamed the identifier prefix to
Prohibitorum, but kept domain-flavoured permission vocabulary in
schema and contracts. **This commit rescopes the project** to four
upstream methods + two downstream protocols, strips that vocabulary,
and lands the schema / package layout / stubs needed for v0.2+ to
build on without further migrations.

### Done

- **Approach A three-layer package layout:**
  `pkg/{account, credential/{webauthn,password,totp,pairing,enrollment},
  federation/oidc, session, authn, protocol/{oidc,saml}, audit}`.
  Files moved with `git mv` to preserve blame history. `pkg/auth/` and
  `pkg/oidc/` deleted.
- **Domain-flavoured vocabulary stripped:**
  - `account.attributes jsonb` replaces five `can_*` boolean columns.
  - `enrollment.template_attributes jsonb` replaces five `template_can_*`
    columns; the intent-check CHECK constraint adapted.
  - `errorx`'s envelope type renamed to the project-agnostic `errorx.Error`.
  - `RPDisplayName` lifted to `configx.WebAuthn.RPDisplayName`
    (default `"Prohibitorum"`).
  - `contract.Permission` enum and `contract.Permissions` struct
    deleted; `AccountView` / `EnrollmentTemplate` carry
    `Attributes map[string]any` instead.
  - `auth.HasPermission` deleted; admin-only endpoints gate on
    `role = 'admin'`, anything finer is per-route attribute inspection.
- **Five migrations applied:**
  - `001_initial.sql` — account, session, webauthn_credential
    (with `user_handle`, `cose_alg`, `uv_initialized`,
    `clone_warning_at`), enrollment (with `template_attributes` +
    `expected_upstream_idp_slug`), credential_event, auth_throttle.
  - `002_oidc.sql` — `signing_key` (unified, with `use sig|enc` and
    `not_before`), `oidc_client` extended per audit
    (`post_logout_redirect_uris`, `allowed_code_challenge_methods`,
    `token_endpoint_auth_method`, `id_token_signed_response_alg`,
    `subject_type`, `application_type`, `default_max_age`,
    `require_auth_time`, `contacts`, `logo_uri`, `tos_uri`,
    `policy_uri`, `disabled`), `revoked_jti`.
  - `003_password_totp.sql` — `password_credential`, `totp_credential`
    (with `secret_enc` + `secret_nonce` + `key_version` + `last_step`),
    `recovery_code` (with `used_session_id` + `used_ip`).
  - `004_federation.sql` — `upstream_idp` (with encrypted
    `client_secret_enc` + `secret_nonce` + `key_version` and three
    provisioning modes), `account_identity` keyed
    `(upstream_iss, upstream_sub)`, forward FK
    `session.upstream_idp_id`.
  - `005_saml.sql` — `saml_sp` (with ordered-array `attribute_map`,
    `require_signed_authn_request`, metadata-freshness fields,
    per-SP `session_lifetime`), `saml_sp_acs`, `saml_sp_key`,
    `saml_subject_id`, `saml_session`.
- **Stub packages** with TODO(v0.X) markers so the import graph is
  whole: `password`, `totp`, `federation/oidc`, `protocol/saml`,
  `authn/flow`, `audit/event`. `audit.Writer` is wired into
  `server.New` so v0.2 handlers can record events without further
  plumbing.
- **`configx` extensions:** `OIDC`, `Federation`, `TOTP`, `SAML`,
  `PasswordHashParams`, `WebAuthn.RPDisplayName`, and a versioned
  `DataEncryptionKeys map[int][]byte` parsed from
  `PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<n>` env vars.
- **Doc rewrites:** `DESIGN.md`, `STATUS.md`, `AUDIT.md`,
  `INTEGRATION.md`, `README.md` aligned to the rescoped service. The
  spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-multi-protocol-rescope-design.md`
  and the three audit reports next to it retain the original
  vocabulary as the audit trail of what was removed.
- **Build state:** `go build ./...` clean, `go test ./...` passes,
  `mise run db:up` applies all five migrations against a fresh
  Postgres.

### Out of scope for this commit

- Any v0.2+ business logic (password / TOTP / federation / SAML /
  OIDC OP). Stubs only.
- Frontend changes (`dashboard/` is empty; v0.6).
- Live smoke test — see v0.1.1 below.

## v0.1.1 — smoke test (done)

Verified the skeleton against a real environment via `cmd/smoke`, an
in-process virtual-authenticator client that drives WebAuthn
ceremonies without a browser. **17/17 steps + DB-state assertions
pass end-to-end** against the live dev server, covering enrollment →
/me → logout → login → second-client login → revoke-by-session-id →
add-second-passkey.

Three runtime bugs the smoke test surfaced (all fixed in the same
session — see commit history):

- `webauthn_credential.cose_alg` was always stored as 0 because the
  server read `cred.Attestation.PublicKeyAlgorithm`, a go-webauthn
  field declared but never assigned by the library. Replaced with
  `pkg/credential/webauthn.COSEAlg(cred.PublicKey)`, which decodes
  the COSE_Key CBOR and extracts integer key 3 per RFC 8152 §7.1.
  New registrations now persist ES256 = -7 correctly.
- The PG `session` table was never written to — sessions stayed
  KV-only. Wired `SessionStore.Issue` to `db.InsertSession` (and
  Revoke variants to `db.RevokeSession` /
  `db.RevokeAllSessionsByAccount`) so v0.4 OIDC can carry
  `sid`/`auth_time`/`amr`/`acr` claims without a follow-up
  migration. WebAuthn issues `amr=["hwk"]`; v0.2 will add `pwd`/
  `otp`/`mfa` for password+TOTP, v0.3 will add `federated`.
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration`'s `claims_supported` advertised
  the picotera-vocabulary `"permissions"` claim. Replaced with the
  spec-correct set: `auth_time`, `amr`, `acr`, `attributes` (plus
  the standard `sub/iss/aud/exp/iat/nonce/username/displayName/role`).

`cmd/smoke` is committed as permanent v0.1.x tooling; v0.2+ will
extend it with password/TOTP and federation flows.

### Smoke-covered runtime paths

The following touched-by-v0.1.x code paths are verified by `cmd/smoke`
against a real Postgres + dev server (see commit `a1ff8a6`):

- `pkg/server/handle_enrollment.go` `insertCredentialForTx` writes
  `cose_alg=-7` (step 4 + DB assertion).
- `pkg/server/handle_me.go:201` `InsertCredential` for the
  add-second-passkey path (steps 16–17 + DB assertion).
- `pkg/session.SessionStore.Issue` writes a row to the PG `session`
  table with `amr={hwk}` on enrollment-complete (step 4) and
  login-complete (step 9) (DB assertion: 3+ rows for the test
  account).
- `pkg/session.SessionStore.Revoke` (called by `/auth/logout`) stamps
  `revoked_at` (step 6 + DB assertion: ≥2 revoked rows).
- `pkg/session.SessionStore.RevokeBySessionID` (called by
  `/me/sessions/revoke`) revokes a non-current session of the same
  account (steps 11–15: client B's session terminated by client A).
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration` `claims_supported` lists
  `attributes` (no `permissions` leak); manual curl confirmed.

### Smoke-untested runtime paths (acknowledged)

The following v0.1.x-touched paths are wired but not currently
exercised by `cmd/smoke`:

- `pkg/session.SessionStore.RevokeAllForAccount` (called by the admin
  endpoint `/accounts/{id}/revoke-sessions`). Code path is
  structurally identical to `RevokeBySessionID` + the
  `RevokeAllSessionsByAccount` SQL UPDATE; would need a second
  account + an admin-impersonation step to drive end-to-end. Deferred.
- `pkg/server/handle_pairing.go:152` (device pairing's session
  issuer with `amr=["hwk"]`). Multi-actor ceremony; the `amr` value
  is the same constant the smoke already verifies in
  enrollment/login. Deferred.

`pkg/session/session_test.go` covers the
`Issue → InsertSession fails → KV rolled back` consistency claim
with a `failingSessionQueries` stub.

### How to re-run the smoke

```bash
# Start the dev server (background terminal):
export PROHIBITORUM_DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
export PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export PROHIBITORUM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN="http://localhost:8080"
mise exec -- go run ./cmd/prohibitorum

# In a second terminal (same env vars; smoke shells out to enroll-admin):
mise exec -- go run ./cmd/smoke
```

## Original v0.1.1 plan (kept for reference)

The pre-smoke version of this section listed manual verification
steps. Most are now automated by `cmd/smoke`; the remaining manual
checks are below.

- `go mod tidy` and lock the indirect dep graph; commit if `go.sum` changed.
- Apply all five migrations to a real Postgres; inspect schemas match the
  spec (`\d account`, `\d session`, `\d webauthn_credential`, etc.).
- Drive `POST /api/prohibitorum/enrollments/{token}/register/{begin,complete}`
  with an HTTP client. The full browser ceremony lands in v0.6 with the
  dashboard; before then, exercise via the API and a virtual-authenticator
  Go integration test (recommended) — see "WebAuthn smoke without a
  frontend" below.
- Hit `/.well-known/openid-configuration` and `/oauth/jwks`; both are
  mounted in v0.1. The discovery doc advertises the planned v0.4 OP
  endpoints; the JWKS endpoint returns an empty `keys` array until v0.4
  introduces signing keys. `/oauth/authorize`, `/oauth/token`,
  `/oauth/userinfo`, `/oidc/logout` are NOT mounted in v0.1 — they land
  in v0.4 with real handler bodies.

### WebAuthn smoke without a frontend

`dashboard/` is empty (v0.6 work). For v0.1.1 smoke testing the WebAuthn
ceremony, two options:

1. **Go integration tests with a virtual authenticator** (recommended).
   Use `go-webauthn`'s test helpers (or a small mock authenticator) to
   drive `register/begin` → `register/complete` server-side. Runs in CI;
   pins ceremony behavior so future migrations can't break it silently.
2. **Defer the full ceremony test to v0.6**. Only run the server-side
   checks above for v0.1.1 (boot, migrations, discovery shape, JWKS
   shape, enrollment token preview). Carries silent-breakage risk between
   now and v0.6 if anyone touches `pkg/credential/webauthn`.

### Operational notes for the smoke test

Two things to know before running v0.1 against any environment:

1. **`PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1` is required at boot.**
   `configx.Parse()` hard-requires at least one
   `PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<n>` env var (32 bytes,
   base64-encoded) to be present before it will return successfully.
   Nothing in v0.1 actually uses the DEK yet — TOTP and upstream-OIDC
   client secrets are the only consumers, and both ship in v0.2 / v0.3
   — but the variable is still mandatory so deployments don't discover
   the requirement only when they try to enroll a TOTP credential.
   Quick generator:

   ```bash
   export PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   ```

   Multiple versions can be loaded simultaneously (`_V1`, `_V2`, …);
   the row's `key_version` column selects which key decrypts it. See
   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-24-multi-protocol-rescope-design.md`
   §"AES-GCM at-rest encryption" for the rotation procedure.

2. **`mise.toml` pins `goose = "3.27.0"`, but mise's default registry
   doesn't ship a `goose` tool.** `mise install` fails on a clean
   machine with a "no plugin found" error. Two workarounds:

   - Use the aqua registry: edit `mise.toml` to read
     `goose = { version = "3.27.0", source = "aqua:pressly/goose" }`.
     **Do not change `mise.toml` as part of v0.1.1** — the fix lives in
     a separate, intentional commit so the change is auditable.
   - Or install goose manually:
     ```bash
     go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
     ```
     and ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is on `$PATH`. This is the workaround the
     smoke test should use; revisit the `mise.toml` edit in a small
     maintenance task once v0.1.1 confirms migrations apply.

## v0.2 — password + TOTP (done)

Shipped the password + TOTP + recovery-code fallback method and the
sudo-step-up extension that gates sensitive `/me` operations behind a
fresh credential proof. Smoke test extended from 17 to **45 steps +
DB-state assertions**, all passing against a live dev server (see
commit `5ccf3fe`).

### What shipped

- **`pkg/credential/password`** — argon2id PHC string at rest, current
  OWASP defaults (`m=64 MiB`, `t=3`, `p=1`), automatic re-hash on
  verify when `configx.PasswordHashParams` advances. Package-init
  `dummyArgon2idHash` defeats step-1 username enumeration (spec D3).
- **`pkg/credential/totp`** — RFC 6238 SHA-1 / 6-digit / 30-second TOTP
  with ±1-step drift, `last_step` defeats same-step replay (RFC 6238
  §5.2). Secrets stored AES-256-GCM with versioned DEK
  (`PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<n>`); AAD bound to
  `'totp:'||account_id||':'||key_version`. Recovery codes
  (10/account, 80-bit entropy, `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` formatted,
  argon2id-hashed at rest) minted at confirmation and regenerable via
  the new `/me/recovery-codes/regenerate` endpoint.
- **`pkg/authn/throttle`** — exponential backoff
  `[0,0,1s,2s,4s,8s,16s,32s,1m,2m,4m,8m,15m]` per `(account_id,
  factor)` (spec D2). Verify entry rejects with `429 Too Many Requests`
  + `Retry-After` when `locked_until > now`, never running the
  expensive crypto check on a locked row. Reset on success.
- **`pkg/audit/event`** — writer body wired up; emits
  `credential_event` rows for `register` / `use` / `fail` / `revoke`
  across `password` / `totp` / `recovery_code` factors, plus
  `session:sudo_granted` on every sudo completion.
- **Two-step login** — `POST /auth/password/begin` returns a
  single-use, 5-minute, KV-backed `partial_session_token`;
  `POST /auth/totp/verify` consumes it and issues a session cookie with
  `amr=["pwd","otp","mfa"]`. Disabled accounts are rejected at
  `/auth/password/begin` after a dummy verify (no timing oracle).
- **Recovery ceremony (2026-05-28 hardening; BREAKING change to the v0.2
  surface).** `/auth/recovery-code/verify` no longer issues a session.
  It consumes the recovery code + partial-session token and returns a
  narrow-scope `recovery_session_token` (10-min TTL, separate KV
  namespace) which the user redeems at the new
  `/auth/recovery/totp/{begin,verify}` endpoints. `/begin` wipes the old
  TOTP credential row and starts a fresh enrollment (recovery codes are
  preserved so the user can retry with another code if they abandon
  mid-ceremony). `/verify` atomically consumes the recovery_session_token,
  confirms the new TOTP, wipes the remaining old recovery codes, mints
  10 fresh ones, and issues a session with `amr=["pwd","otp","mfa"]`.
  Rationale: NIST SP 800-63B-4 §5.2 cautions against knowledge factors
  for reauthentication — the previous design let a stolen session +
  leaked recovery code escalate to full takeover via sudo.
- **Sudo extension** — `pkg/authn/flow.AvailableMethods` enumerates
  per-account sudo factors in priority order
  (`webauthn` → `password_totp`). `recovery_code` is **NOT** a sudo
  method (recovery routes through the ceremony, not the gate). New
  `GET /me/sudo/methods` returns the list; `/me/sudo/begin` and
  `/me/sudo/complete` accept a `method` discriminator (was
  WebAuthn-only in v0.1).
- **WebAuthn-preferred factor policy** —
  `POST /me/auth/revoke-password-totp` transactionally deletes the
  caller's `password_credential`, `totp_credential`, and
  `recovery_code` rows. Sudo-gated.

### Endpoints introduced in v0.2

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/password/begin` | step 1 of two-step login |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/totp/verify` | step 2: TOTP |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/recovery-code/verify` | step 2 of recovery: returns `recovery_session_token` (no session) |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/recovery/totp/begin` | recovery ceremony: re-enroll TOTP (recovery codes preserved) |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/recovery/totp/verify` | recovery ceremony: confirm + mint 10 fresh codes + issue session |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/password/set` | sudo-gated |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/totp/begin` | sudo-gated iff confirmed TOTP exists |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/totp/verify` | confirms enrollment, returns recovery codes |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/recovery-codes/regenerate` | sudo-gated |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/auth/revoke-password-totp` | sudo-gated, destructive |
| GET  | `/api/prohibitorum/me/sudo/methods` | NEW in v0.2 |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/sudo/begin` | extended to accept `method` param |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/sudo/complete` | extended to dispatch on `method` |

### Smoke-covered runtime paths

`cmd/smoke` exercises every v0.2 endpoint end-to-end against a real
Postgres + dev server. Each entry below references the smoke step
counter in `cmd/smoke/main.go`:

- `/me/sudo/begin` + `/me/sudo/complete` via WebAuthn — steps 18, 41
  (and prerequisite for password/set and revoke-password-totp).
- `/me/password/set` — step 19; DB assert `password_credential.hash`
  prefix `$argon2id$v=19$` at step 20.
- `/me/totp/begin` — step 21 (no sudo, first enrollment); decodes
  `secret_base32`, captures `otpauth_uri`.
- `/me/totp/verify` — step 22 (confirmation); DB assert
  `totp_credential.confirmed_at IS NOT NULL` + 10 `recovery_code` rows
  at step 23.
- `/auth/password/begin` + `/auth/totp/verify` (two-step login) —
  steps 25–26, RFC 6238 §5.2 replay window respected
  (`waitForNextTOTPStep`). `/me` round-trips post-login at step 27.
- **Recovery ceremony** — `/auth/password/begin` (step 29) →
  `/auth/recovery-code/verify` returning `recovery_session_token`
  (step 30; no session cookie) → DB assert `recovery_code[0].used_at`
  (step 31) → `/auth/recovery/totp/begin` (step 32a) → DB assert TOTP
  unconfirmed + 9 recovery codes preserved (32b) →
  `/auth/recovery/totp/verify` (32c) → DB assert TOTP confirmed +
  exactly 10 recovery codes (32d) → `/me` round-trip post-recovery
  (32e). Catches the most common regression (premature recovery-code
  wipe at `/begin`).
- `/me/sudo/begin` + `/me/sudo/complete` via `password_totp` — step
  37.
- `/me/recovery-codes/regenerate` — step 38 (consumes a sudo grant;
  asserts 10 fresh codes returned and old set invalidated).
- **Recovery-code sudo rejection** — `/me/sudo/methods` must NOT list
  `recovery_code` (step 39); `/me/sudo/begin {method:"recovery_code"}`
  must return 400 `sudo_method_unavailable` (step 40). Guards the
  hardening invariant.
- `/me/auth/revoke-password-totp` — step 42; DB assert that
  `password_credential` / `totp_credential` / `recovery_code` are all
  empty for the account at step 43; step 44 confirms
  `/auth/password/begin` returns 401 post-revoke.
- **Throttle observation** — step 34 drives wrong TOTP codes through
  `/me/sudo/begin` + `/me/sudo/complete` until the throttle responds
  `429`; step 35 asserts the `auth_throttle` row has
  `failed_attempts >= 3` and `locked_until > now`. Step 36 is a
  HARNESS-ONLY `DELETE FROM auth_throttle` so the rest of the smoke
  can proceed.
- **Audit emission** — step 45 asserts `credential_event` covers the
  union of (factor, event) pairs the v0.2 surface emits this run:
  `password:{register,use,revoke}`, `totp:{register,use,revoke}`,
  `recovery_code:{register≥10,use≥1,revoke≥9}`,
  `session:sudo_granted≥3`. The `recovery_code:use` count dropped from
  ≥2 to ≥1 post 2026-05-28 hardening (sudo-via-recovery-code path
  removed); `recovery_code:revoke` raised to ≥9 to cover the
  `recovery_complete` revoke chain emitted by the ceremony.
  `totp:{register,revoke}` are ≥2 (initial + recovery-ceremony commit).

### Smoke-untested runtime paths (acknowledged)

The following v0.2-touched paths are wired and unit-tested but not
exercised end-to-end by `cmd/smoke`:

- **Disabled-account rejection at `/auth/password/begin`.** The
  handler at `handle_auth_password.go:70` runs the dummy argon2id
  verify and returns `bad_credentials` when `account.Disabled = true`,
  matching spec D3 (no timing oracle for disabled-vs-enabled). The
  smoke account is never disabled mid-run.
- **`/me/sudo/methods`.** The endpoint is mounted and unit-tested
  (handler computes priority order via `AvailableMethods`), but the
  smoke calls `/me/sudo/begin` directly with each method rather than
  reading from the discovery endpoint first.
- **TOTP enrollment overwrite after a failed verify.** Spec D4 says
  a second `/me/totp/begin` UPSERTs the row with a fresh secret when
  `confirmed_at` is still NULL. Unit-tested in `handle_me_totp_test.go`
  but the smoke confirms a fresh TOTP on the first try, so the
  overwrite path doesn't fire.
- **`/me/totp/begin` sudo-gated re-enrollment.** When a confirmed TOTP
  already exists, a fresh `/me/totp/begin` requires sudo. Unit-tested;
  the smoke enrolls once, never replaces.
- **`PasswordHashParams` upgrade-on-verify re-hash.** Verify path in
  `pkg/credential/password` re-encodes the PHC string when the
  configured params advance. Unit-tested; the smoke runs against a
  single param set, so the re-hash branch isn't taken.
- **Throttle clearing on subsequent success.** The DELETE-on-success
  branch in `pkg/authn/throttle` is unit-tested. The smoke deliberately
  clears the throttle row via `psql DELETE` (`resetThrottle`) so it
  can continue past the lockout, rather than waiting it out and
  observing the natural reset.
- **Partial-session-token replay.** Single-use, expire-after-5-min
  semantics in `pkg/authn/flow`. Unit-tested. The smoke consumes each
  token exactly once; no replay attempt.

`pkg/credential/password`, `pkg/credential/totp`, `pkg/authn/throttle`,
`pkg/authn/flow`, and `pkg/server/handle_*_test.go` carry the unit
coverage for the cases above.

### Notes

- `pkg/credential/totp.ComputeCodeForTesting` is exported intentionally
  so `cmd/smoke` can compute the current RFC 6238 code with the same
  primitive the server uses on verify. It is the only path that exposes
  the secret post-encryption; never call from production code.
- Smoke step count is **45**, not the 46 the plan originally drafted.
  The 46th step (sudo before `/me/totp/begin` for first-time
  enrollment) was redundant per spec — first TOTP enrollment is not
  sudo-gated when no confirmed credential exists. 45 is correct.

## v0.2.1 — open follow-ups

None currently identified. The reality audit at the close of v0.2
(this section) is the canonical follow-up list; reopen when concrete
deferred items materialise.

## v0.3 — upstream OIDC federation (done)

Shipped the upstream OIDC RP surface: all three provisioning modes
(`auto_provision`, `link_only`, **`invite_only`**) end-to-end,
`/me/identities` list / unlink / link, AES-256-GCM at-rest for
upstream client secrets, JWT alg allowlist, RFC 9207 iss callback
validation, federation-state KV with cross-namespace defense,
session-swap defense on the link flow, and AMR pass-through (with
`["federated"]` backfill). Smoke extended from 45 to **69 steps**
against a real Postgres + dev server + in-process mock OP (see
`cmd/smoke/internal/mockop`).

`invite_only` ships as token-bearing redemption: an admin mints an
invite via the existing `/admin/enrollments/*` surface with
`intent='invite'` and `expected_upstream_idp_slug='<slug>'`. The user
clicks `GET /api/prohibitorum/enrollments/{token}/start-federation`,
which redirects to the upstream `/authorize`; the callback dispatches
into `applyInviteOnly` instead of the IdP-mode default and atomically
consumes the enrollment + mints the account + inserts the identity
inside one pgx transaction (`pkg/federation/oidc/modes.go`
`runInviteTx`). Audit (`credential_event` register + use) is emitted
via a tx-scoped Writer so the `account_id` FK to `account.id` resolves
against the just-inserted-but-not-yet-committed row — see the
"Bugs found and fixed" note below.

### What shipped

- **`pkg/federation/oidc/secret.go`** — AES-256-GCM for
  `upstream_idp.client_secret_enc` with the versioned-DEK family
  (`PROHIBITORUM_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V<n>`). AAD bound to
  `'upstream_idp:'||id||':'||key_version` so a ciphertext lifted
  between rows fails to decrypt. 12-byte per-row nonce. 5/5 unit tests
  in `secret_test.go`.
- **`pkg/federation/oidc/client.go`** — wraps `zitadel/oidc/v3 v3.47.5`.
  Discovery fired once at `NewClient`; the library caches JWKS
  internally. ID-token alg allowlist
  (`DefaultAllowedAlgs() = {RS256, ES256, EdDSA}`) enforced at the
  library layer AND re-checked post-decode (defense-in-depth against
  a library bug that admits `HS256` / `none`). Nonce threaded via
  context-key.
- **`pkg/federation/oidc/federation.go`** — `Federator` orchestrates
  `BeginLogin` / `HandleCallback` / `LinkBegin` / `LinkCallback`.
  Federation-state KV is keyed under `LoginKey(token)` vs
  `LinkKey(token)` — a state token minted for a link flow cannot be
  consumed by the public login callback, and vice versa
  (cross-namespace defense, unit-tested). State is single-use via
  `kvStore.Pop`. State payload snapshots `ExpectedIss` +
  `ExpectedTokenEndpoint` + `Nonce` + `CodeVerifier` so a discovery
  change mid-flow can't silently re-target the user to a different OP.
  RFC 9207 `iss` callback parameter validated against
  `state.ExpectedIss`. Post-`Resolve` disabled-account check returns
  `authn.ErrBadCredentials()` — same enumeration-safe path as the
  password login (federation.go:269).
- **`pkg/federation/oidc/modes.go`** — three provisioning modes:
  - `auto_provision` gated by `RequireVerifiedEmail` +
    `AllowedDomains` + `preferred_username` presence + local
    username-collision check. Mints a fresh `webauthn_user_handle` on
    JIT so a federated user can enroll a passkey later. Emits
    `register` + `use` audit rows on success.
  - `invite_only` — token-bearing redemption via
    `GET /enrollments/{token}/start-federation`. The HTTP shim
    (`pkg/server/handle_invite_federation.go`) validates the invite
    upfront via `Federator.BeginInviteRedemption`, stashes the
    enrollment token in `FedState.EnrollmentToken`, and 302s to the
    upstream `/authorize`. The callback notices the token on FedState
    and dispatches `applyInviteOnly` instead of `Resolve`-by-mode.
    Inside `runInviteTx`, a single pgx transaction wraps
    `ConsumeEnrollment` + `InsertAccount` + `InsertAccountIdentity` +
    the `register`/`use` audit emission via a tx-scoped Writer.
    Skips `RequireVerifiedEmail` + `AllowedDomains` by design (D11):
    the admin minted the invite specifically for this user, which IS
    the authorization. Username collision is re-checked at redemption
    time (race-bound to invite-create). Audit emits
    `reason: "invite_only_redemption"` on success;
    `invite_consumed_or_expired` / `invite_slug_mismatch` /
    `username_collision` on the in-tx fail branches; and
    `invite_lookup_failed` / `invite_wrong_intent` /
    `invite_already_consumed` / `invite_expired` /
    `invite_not_federated` at the `BeginInviteRedemption` pre-flight
    (each emits `failNoAccount` via the outer audit writer).
  - `link_only` — rejects unknown `(iss, sub)` with `link_required`.
  - Re-login claim sync (spec D2): updates `account.display_name`
    when upstream `name` drifts; updates `account_identity.upstream_email`
    when upstream email drifts; both conditional on a diff so the
    `updated_at` trigger doesn't fire on no-op logins
    (`modes.go:240–267`).
- **HTTP surface** — `pkg/server/handle_federation.go` (public login
  + callback) and `pkg/server/handle_me_identities.go` (sudo-gated
  link + unlink). Public endpoints share one IP rate-limit bucket
  (`federation:ip:<ip>` @ 30/min). Return-to validation rejects
  anything that isn't a relative path beginning with `/` and not `//`
  (`handle_federation.go:145`). AMR backfilled to `["federated"]`
  when upstream omits the claim (`handle_federation.go:127–130`,
  citing RFC 8176 §2).
- **`/me/identities` flow** — link begin is sudo-gated; link callback
  is NOT sudo-gated (the user just elevated at `/begin` and a fresh
  sudo prompt after the upstream round-trip would be hostile UX).
  `LinkCallback` validates that the current session matches the
  `LinkingAccountID` stashed in state — defeats a session-swap
  mid-flow where the attacker lures the victim's browser to complete
  the attacker's link (`federation.go:307–312`, unit-tested).
- **Unlink last-method check** — `handleMeIdentitiesUnlinkHTTP`
  computes the post-unlink method set and rejects with
  `last_sign_in_method` when the only remaining method on the account
  is the very identity row being unlinked
  (`handle_me_identities.go:121–145`).
- **`pkg/authn` errors** — 8 new structured errors:
  403 `email_not_verified` / `username_collision` /
  `invite_required` / `link_required`;
  401 `federation_state_invalid`;
  400 `last_sign_in_method` / `invalid_return_to` /
  `upstream_error{code, description}` (`errors.go:274–339`).
- **`pkg/authn.AvailableMethods`** — now appends
  `MethodFederationOIDC` when the account has ≥1 `account_identity`
  row (`flow.go:75–81`). Drives the `/me/sudo/methods` discovery
  surface and the unlink last-method computation.
- **Migration 006** — `006_federation_v03.sql` added
  `upstream_idp.require_verified_email BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true`.
  The `account_identity` table and the rest of the `upstream_idp`
  schema were already in migration 004 (v0.1 skeleton).

### Endpoints introduced in v0.3

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/federation/{slug}/login` | public; 302 to upstream `/authorize` |
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/auth/federation/{slug}/callback` | public; handles `?error=`; issues session |
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/enrollments/{token}/start-federation` | public (token-bearing); 302 to upstream `/authorize` after validating the invite; emits `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` so the token doesn't leak to the upstream |
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/me/identities` | session-required; JSON array `[{id, idpSlug, idpDisplayName, upstreamEmail, linkedAt}]` |
| POST | `/api/prohibitorum/me/identities/{id}/unlink` | session + sudo; 204 on success; refuses when this is the last sign-in method |
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/me/identities/link/{slug}/begin` | session + sudo; 302 to upstream `/authorize` (LinkKey-namespaced state) |
| GET | `/api/prohibitorum/me/identities/link/{slug}/callback` | session-required (not sudo); validates session matches state.LinkingAccountID; does NOT issue a new session |

### Smoke-covered runtime paths

`cmd/smoke` extends from 45 to **69 steps**. The v0.3 block is steps
46–69; the in-process mock OP under `cmd/smoke/internal/mockop`
signs ES256 ID tokens against a JWKS served from the test process.
Each entry below references the smoke step counter in
`cmd/smoke/main.go`:

- **Seed upstream_idp** — step 46/69 inserts `mockop` (auto_provision,
  AES-GCM-encrypted client secret, allowed_domains `["example.com"]`,
  `require_verified_email = true`).
- **Happy-path login** — steps 47/69–49/69 walk
  `/auth/federation/mockop/login` → upstream `/authorize` →
  RP `/callback` → 302 to `/me` with a session cookie.
  Step 50/69 round-trips `/me` as the federated user.
- **JIT row inserted** — step 51/69 DB-asserts an `account_identity`
  row exists for `ext-user-1` with `(upstream_iss, upstream_sub)`
  matching the mock OP's claims.
- **Re-login claim sync (D2)** — step 52/69 changes the upstream
  display name, re-logs in, DB-asserts `account.display_name` updated.
- **email_not_verified** — step 53/69 sets the mock OP's
  `email_verified=false`, drives a fresh login, asserts 403 +
  `email_not_verified` error code.
- **username_collision** — step 54/69 changes the mock OP's
  `preferred_username` to a value that already exists locally,
  asserts 403 + `username_collision`.
- **invalid_return_to** — step 55/69 passes `return_to=//evil.example`
  to `/login`, asserts 400 + `invalid_return_to`. Caught at the
  HTTP layer before the federator runs (no audit emission expected).
- **upstream_error** — step 56/69 simulates the OP returning
  `?error=access_denied`, asserts 400 + `upstream_error` and a
  `fail` audit row with `reason: "upstream_error"`.
- **`GET /me/identities`** — step 57/69 lists 1 row for the
  federated user; asserts `idpSlug`, `idpDisplayName`,
  `upstreamEmail`, and an ISO-8601 `linkedAt`.
- **Seed second IdP** — step 58/69 inserts `mockop-link`
  (link_only mode).
- **link_only refuses unknown** — step 59/69 drives a login for a
  fresh upstream sub against the `link_only` IdP; asserts 403 +
  `link_required` + a `fail` audit row.
- **Self-service link** — step 60/69 re-logs in as `smoke-admin`
  via WebAuthn. Step 61/69 sudos via WebAuthn, hits
  `/me/identities/link/mockop/begin`, follows through the mock OP,
  asserts the original session cookie survives the round-trip
  (no new session minted by the link callback).
- **Link DB-asserted** — step 62/69 confirms an `account_identity`
  row exists for `admin-link-1` owned by the `smoke-admin` account.
- **List as admin** — step 63/69 confirms `/me/identities` returns
  exactly 1 row for `smoke-admin` post-link.
- **Unlink** — step 64/69 sudos via WebAuthn and POSTs
  `/me/identities/{id}/unlink`, asserts 204 and DB row gone.
  The smoke-admin survives the unlink because they still have
  WebAuthn — the last-sign-in-method guard is satisfied.
- **invite_only end-to-end** — step 65/69 seeds an
  `intent='invite'` enrollment with
  `expected_upstream_idp_slug='mockop'`, then drives
  `GET /enrollments/{token}/start-federation?return_to=/me` →
  upstream `/authorize` → RP `/callback` → 302 to `/me` + session
  cookie. Confirms `/me` returns the template `username` and
  `displayName` (NOT the upstream `preferred_username`/`name`,
  proving the invite template overrides the OP claims).
- **invite_only DB asserts** — step 66/69 confirms
  `enrollment.consumed_at IS NOT NULL`, the account row exists
  with the template username, the `account_identity` row links to
  the upstream sub under the IdP, and a `credential_event` row
  exists with `factor='federation_oidc' event='register'
  detail->>'reason' = 'invite_only_redemption'`.
- **invite_only consumed-token rejection** — step 67/69 reuses
  the already-redeemed token; the federator's
  `BeginInviteRedemption` rejects pre-flight with
  403 `invite_required` (no upstream hop made).
- **invite_only expired-token rejection** — step 68/69 seeds a
  fresh enrollment with `expires_at = now() - interval '1 second'`
  and confirms 403 `invite_required`.
- **Audit emission** — step 69/69 asserts `credential_event`
  lower bounds for the v0.3 lifecycle:
  `federation_oidc:register ≥ 2` (auto_provision +
  invite_only_redemption),
  `federation_oidc:use ≥ 4` (3× existing + invite session-start),
  `federation_oidc:fail ≥ 6` (4× existing + invite consumed +
  invite expired),
  `federation_oidc:link ≥ 1`, `federation_oidc:unlink ≥ 1`.
  Observed run: `register:2, use:4, fail:6, link:1, unlink:1`.

### Smoke-untested runtime paths (acknowledged)

The following v0.3-touched paths are wired but not exercised
end-to-end by `cmd/smoke`. Most carry unit-test coverage in
`pkg/federation/oidc/*_test.go` or `pkg/server/handle_me_identities_test.go`.

- **invite_only username_collision at redemption.**
  `applyInviteOnly` re-checks username availability at redemption
  time (race against a concurrent invite mint or password sign-up
  taking the slot between invite-create and redemption);
  `pkg/federation/oidc/modes.go` `username_collision` branch is
  unit-tested in `modes_test.go` but the smoke can't easily stage
  the race so it's not exercised end-to-end.
- **invite_only transactional rollback.** `runInviteTx` rolls back
  the consume + insert + audit when any in-tx step fails. Unit-tested
  via fake querier in `modes_test.go`. The smoke can't reliably stage
  a mid-tx failure (the upstream OP doesn't lie about the code
  exchange).
- **invite_only `expected_upstream_idp_slug` mismatch.** If the
  invite is bound to slug A but the user somehow drives it through
  slug B's callback, `applyInviteOnly` rejects with
  `invite_slug_mismatch`. Unit-tested only — the smoke's
  `start-federation` handler binds the IdP by reading
  `enrollment.expected_upstream_idp_slug`, so reaching the
  mid-flight slug edit branch requires DB-level tampering that
  isn't worth automating.
- **`iss_mismatch_callback` (RFC 9207 reject).** Federator rejects a
  callback whose `?iss=` doesn't match `state.ExpectedIss`. Unit-test
  in `federation_test.go` only — the smoke uses a single mock OP, so
  a mismatch can't be staged without a second OP.
- **Cross-namespace state reuse.** A `LoginKey`-namespaced token
  cannot be redeemed via the link callback (and vice versa).
  Unit-tested in `federation_test.go`. The smoke never attempts the
  swap.
- **Session-swap defense on LinkCallback.** `state.LinkingAccountID`
  must match the current session's `Account.ID`. Unit-tested
  (`federation_test.go`). The smoke flows the link callback under
  the same session that issued `/begin`.
- **`code_exchange_failed` from upstream.** The mock OP always
  honors the code. Unit-tested via a stubbed exchange in
  `federation_test.go`.
- **Disabled-account check post-Resolve.** Federator returns
  `authn.ErrBadCredentials()` if an admin disables the account
  between provisioning and session-mint
  (`federation.go:269–278`). Unit-tested; the smoke account is
  never disabled mid-flow.
- **Unlink-last for a federated-only user.** The
  `last_sign_in_method` reject is unit-tested in
  `handle_me_identities_test.go`. The smoke can't drive it
  end-to-end: the unlink endpoint is sudo-gated, and a
  federated-only user has no sudo method available
  (`recovery_code` was de-listed in v0.2 post-2026-05-28 hardening,
  and federation is not a sudo method).
- **Upstream refresh tokens.** Not implemented. Federated accounts
  re-authenticate via `/login` each time — Prohibitorum does not
  store or refresh upstream OIDC tokens. Tracked as ❌ in AUDIT.md.
- **HS256 / `none` rejection by the alg allowlist.** The mock OP
  only signs ES256, so the post-decode alg recheck branch is
  `t.Skip`ed in `client_test.go`. The library-level allowlist
  still rejects via configuration.
- **Per-IdP claim-name overrides.** `upstream_idp.username_claim` /
  `display_name_claim` / `email_claim` columns exist in the schema
  but are NOT consumed by `modes.go` — auto_provision reads
  `tokens.PreferredUsername` / `tokens.Name` / `tokens.Email`
  directly. Tracked as a ⚠️ gap in AUDIT.md. Most OPs use the
  defaults (`preferred_username` / `name` / `email`) so this is
  benign for common deployments; closing the gap requires either
  plumbing the per-IdP overrides through `client.Exchange` or
  applying them in `modes.go` after claim extraction.

### Notes

- The mock OP under `cmd/smoke/internal/mockop` is a deliberately
  minimal in-process OP — discovery, JWKS, `/authorize`, `/token`
  with PKCE, ES256 signing. It exists so the smoke can drive an
  upstream round-trip without booting Keycloak. Not safe for
  production; never reuse outside the smoke harness.
- Federation rate limiting reuses the existing in-process
  `pkg/authn/ratelimit` bucket. The multi-replica caveat
  documented in `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-05-28-v0.2-deployment-notes.md`
  §1 applies here too.

### Bugs found in stage 3 (invite_only smoke) and fixed

- **`applyInviteOnly` audit FK race against uncommitted account row.**
  The first invite-redemption smoke run surfaced missing
  `credential_event` rows for `factor='federation_oidc'
  event='register' detail->>'reason'='invite_only_redemption'`.
  Root cause: the audit `Writer` was the federator's outer
  pool-bound writer (`f.audit`), so `InsertCredentialEvent` ran on
  a different connection from the in-tx `InsertAccount`. The
  `credential_event.account_id` FK to `account.id` was checked
  against the MVCC snapshot of the other connection — which
  didn't yet see the uncommitted account row — so the insert
  silently failed (the Writer swallows errors by convention) and
  no audit row landed. Fix: `runInviteTx` now constructs a
  tx-scoped `audit.Writer` (`audit.NewWriter(qtx)`) and passes it
  to the closure; the audit insert runs inside the same tx as
  the account insert, so the FK resolves and rollback semantics
  are correct (no orphan audit rows). See
  `pkg/federation/oidc/modes.go` `runInviteTx` + the
  `applyInviteOnly` audit block. The smoke step 66/69 assertion
  is the regression gate.

## v0.4 — OIDC OP (downstream)

- `signing-key generate` subcommand: RSA-2048, JWK + self-signed x509
  + PEM in one shot, written to `signing_key`.
- `/oauth/authorize`: query-param validation, session check, code
  mint, redirect with `iss`.
- `/oauth/token`: `authorization_code` + `refresh_token` grants;
  refresh rotation with reuse detection; family revocation on code
  replay.
- `/oauth/userinfo`: access-token verification, claim projection.
- `/oauth/introspect`: Pattern B for first-party RPs.
- `/oidc/logout`: RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 with
  `post_logout_redirect_uri` exact-match.
- ID-token claims include `auth_time`, `amr`, `acr`, `azp`, `at_hash`
  per OIDC Core §2.
- Access tokens emit RFC 9068 `typ: at+jwt` + `jti`; `revoked_jti`
  consulted on introspection.
- Rate limit on `/authorize` and `/token` (audit-flagged ❌ gap from v0.1).

## v0.5 — SAML IdP

- `crewjam/saml` integration; `/saml/metadata` publishes the IdP
  `<EntityDescriptor>` with all live + grace-period signing keys.
- `/saml/sso` SP-initiated SSO (HTTP-Redirect + HTTP-POST AuthnRequest).
- Signed `<Response>` + `<Assertion>`; `Destination` = ACS URL;
  `<Audience>` = `entity_id`; `AuthnContextClassRef` per spec.
- Stable pairwise NameID via `saml_subject_id` (32-byte random base64url
  generated on first SSO).
- Attribute mapping (ordered JSONB array): URI / basic / unspecified
  NameFormat; multi-valued attributes (`emails`, `public_keys`,
  `gpg_keys`).
- `saml_session` populated from day one; `/saml/slo` (Single Logout)
  consumes it.
- GHES preset: `sp_kind='ghes'` auto-sets
  `require_signed_authn_request=true` and uses persistent 1.1 NameID.

## v0.6 — Frontend

- `dashboard/` scaffolded with pnpm + vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind v4.
- Passkey ceremony SDK (lifted from the origin project), `PasskeyPopupHost`,
  `SessionsCard`, `PairApproveDialog`, `PairingCode` /
  `PairingCodeInput`.
- `LoginView` with method selection (WebAuthn / password+TOTP /
  federation), `?return_to=` handling that posts the user back to
  `/oauth/authorize` after sign-in.
- `EnrollView`, `MeView` (with attributes + linked IdPs +
  passkeys + password/TOTP setup), `AccountsView`,
  `RecoverChoiceView`, `AdminRecoveryView`, `CodeLoginView`.
- New views: `ClientsView` (OIDC clients), `IdPsView` (upstream OIDC),
  `SPsView` (SAML).

## v0.7+ — Hardening

- KMS-backed signing keys (AWS KMS / GCP KMS / Vault Transit adapter).
- Signing-key rotation UX (admin button + scheduled rotation job).
- Audit-log export to SIEM (kafka / file / stdout structured).
- Admin UI polish for clients / SPs / IdPs.
- Pairwise sub identifiers (RFC 9068 + OIDC Core §8.1).
- DPoP / PAR / JAR (only when a low-trust client demands them).
- Front-channel / back-channel logout for coordinated SSO sign-out.
- Conditional UI (passkey autofill) for username-first flows.
- Content Security Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options headers from the
  static handler (currently reverse-proxy responsibility).

## Why ship the rescope as a skeleton

The schema and package boundaries are the load-bearing decisions; once
they're committed, v0.2+ work can land in focused PRs without
disturbing them. Splitting "rescope" from "v0.2 password+TOTP
implementation" is reviewable in isolation — the v0.1 commit is purely
structural, and the audit reports in `docs/superpowers/specs/` give
the per-layer authoritative checklist that v0.2+ will tick off.
